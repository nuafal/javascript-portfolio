# 🚀 JavaScript Engineering Journey (7-Month Milestone)

This repository serves as a professional portfolio documenting my progression from JavaScript fundamentals to advanced 3D rendering and state-managed web applications.

## 📂 Project Highlights

### 1. Dev Dashboard (Advanced Web App)
A gamified, persistent dashboard that demonstrates complex UI/UX and data handling.
* **Tech:** ES6+, CSS Grid, LocalStorage API, FileReader API.
* **Key Feature:** Persistent state management ensures user Level, XP, and Profile data survive page refreshes.
* **Architecture:** Modular design with a dedicated sidebar, modal-based settings, and dynamic content rendering.

### 2. 3D ASCII Renderer (Visual Showcase)
A high-impact 3D scene converted into real-time ASCII art.
* **Tech:** Three.js, WebGL, AsciiEffect.js.
* **Key Feature:** Procedural animation and interactive camera controls (TrackballControls).
* **Architecture:** Professional module-based library integration using Import Maps.

### 3. Arithmetic Lab (Fundamentals)
A sandbox for testing core JavaScript logic and operator precedence.
* **Tech:** Vanilla JS, DOM Manipulation.
* **Key Feature:** Dynamic calculation engine with real-time feedback.

## 🛠️ Technical Competencies
* **System Architecture:** Implementing Global State across multiple UI components.
* **Data Persistence:** CRUD operations using browser LocalStorage.
* **DevOps Workflow:** Organized file structures, separation of concerns, and documentation-first development.
* **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first layouts built with CSS Grid and Flexbox.
